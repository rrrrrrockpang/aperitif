    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Thank you for taking the time to consider this study. This form explains what would happen if you join this research project. Please read it carefully and take as much time as you need.
    In this task, you will preregister two similar experiments. In one experiment, you will use a preregistration template.
    In the other experiment, you will preregister with a different interface. You are also asked to scratch codes for statistical analysis.
    This study will take around 1 hour and you will be compensated $15 for your participation. Feel free to use any resources online during the study.

    <h3>Title</h3>
    Understanding Preregistration and Data Analysis

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    The purpose of this project is to study how people preregister their studies and how can we improve the experience.

    <h3>Procedures</h3>
    During this project, you will be asked to preregister two similar synthesized experiments. The experiments are not complex.

    <br><br>

    In one experiment, you will be presented with a synthesized experiment first. Then you need to complete a preregistration form using AsPredicted.org, which is a standard experimental preregistration website.
    After completing the form, you will be asked to write data analysis code to materialize your experimental plan, using any programming software you are most familiar with (R, Python, STATA, etc). Please open the software before entering the next page.
    Think of this as you need to analyze your collected data in your research process after preregistration. We will provide you with a synthesized dataset which can be used to aid your programming.

    <br><br>

    In another scenario, you will also be presented with an experiment first. Then, you need to complete a preregistration using the interface built on top the AsPredicted.org website.

    <br><br>

    The order of the two scenarios and two experiments will be randomized.

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    We will collect your feedback on the preregistration template, interface, and the whole process. We will also collect your demographic information.
    De-identified data will be used for future research or given to another investigator for future use without additional consent.
